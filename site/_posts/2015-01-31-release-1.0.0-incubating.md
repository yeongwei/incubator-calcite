Calcite's first major release.

Since the previous release we have re-organized the into the `org.apache.calcite`
namespace. To make migration of your code easier, we have described the
<a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12681620/mapping.txt">mapping from old to new class names</a>
as an attachment to
[<a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-296">CALCITE-296</a>].

The release adds SQL support for `GROUPING SETS`, `EXTEND`, `UPSERT` and sequences;
a remote JDBC driver;
improvements to the planner engine and built-in planner rules;
improvements to the algorithms that implement the relational algebra,
including an interpreter that can evaluate queries without compilation;
and fixes about 30 bugs.
