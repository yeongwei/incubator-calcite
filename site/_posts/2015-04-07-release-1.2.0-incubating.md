A short release, less than a month after 1.1.

There have been many changes to Avatica, hugely improving its coverage of the
JDBC API and overall robustness. A new provider, `JdbcMeta`, allows
you to remote an existing JDBC driver.

[<a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-606">CALCITE-606</a>]
improves how the planner propagates traits such as collation and
distribution among relational expressions.

[<a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-613">CALCITE-613</a>]
and [<a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-307">CALCITE-307</a>]
improve implicit and explicit conversions in SQL.
