This Calcite release makes it possible to exploit physical properties
of relational expressions to produce more efficient plans, introducing
collation and distribution as traits, `Exchange` relational operator,
and several new forms of metadata.

We add experimental support for streaming SQL.

This release drops support for JDK 1.6; Calcite now requires 1.7 or
later.

We have introduced static `create` methods for many sub-classes of
`RelNode`. We strongly suggest that you use these rather than
calling constructors directly.
