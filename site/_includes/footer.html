  <p>Apache Calcite is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache
      Software Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the Apache
      Incubator. Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects
      until a further review indicates that the infrastructure,
      communications, and decision making process have stabilized in a
      manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While
      incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the
      completeness or stability of the code, it does indicate that the
      project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.</p>
